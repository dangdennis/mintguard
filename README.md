# MintGuard

Building tools to prevent NFT enthusiasts from getting scammed.

## **Problem**

Users in the rush to mint pre-sale primary NFTs may end up on the scam sites. Although many are trained to only enter through primary communications official, i.e. Discord channels for official links, it's still possible new minters forget or perhaps have been socially coerced onto fake sites that steal their NFTs or money.

## **Implementation**

Mintguard exists as two parts, a web extension and a risk evaluation service. Our extension informs users of a site's risk levels based on domain and wallet address. Additionally, users can upvote and downvote sites that stumble upon to signal user-driven risk levels.
